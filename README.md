# design-system

Sample design system built with vanilla extract and storybook. Demonstrates a few vanilla extract features such as themes, sprinkles, variants and atoms and using these ideas to create a polymorphic `Box` component in order to easily expose reusable css properties.

Inspired by https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system and https://sandroroth.com/blog/vanilla-extract-approach.

## Install

## Running storybook
